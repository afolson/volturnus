Don't see your IRCd? Feel free to open a feature request.

## Requesting Help

**PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR HELP WITH VOLTURNUS VIA YOUR IRCD'S HELP CHANNEL.**

Volturnus includes pre-filled configuration files to help you get set up quickly. These are NOT supported by your IRCd's development team.

If you need help, please visit irc.zomgirc.net/#volturnus. Please note that we will not help you troubleshoot issues in code that you modify. However, if you're adding functionality to Volturnus we'd love to hear about what you're doing and why!

## Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements

Please open an issue or create a pull request in order to report a bug or suggest a feature.

When reporting bugs, please list the following information:

* Which version of Volturnus you are running
* Which version of PHP/Apache you are using (optional)

* Steps to reproduce

Please label feature requests as "enhancements" when opening an issue.
