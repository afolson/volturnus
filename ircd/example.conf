 * Includes:																*
 *																			*
 * config.conf - This file is what is included from the config admin. You 	*
 * will need this file if you are using the cron system. A blank one is 	*
 * included for you, and you don't need	to do anything with it.				*
 * 																			*
 * Remote Includes:															*
 * 																			*
 * If you have compiled your IRCd with remote includes, you will need to	*
 * include a line like the line below (looks like a webpage URL). You will	*
 * need the server name, password, and location of the admin interface to	*
 * make this URL. The password is the password you specified in the config 	*
 * admin, not the password used to connect to the server or link servers.	*
 *																			*
 * links.conf - You may or may not need this file, but it is advised that	*
 * you put any link blocks (such as the link to your hub) in here. You WILL	*
 * need this file if you decide to include the class blocks remotely.		*
 *																			*
 * help.conf - This is the help that appears in /helpop queries. Just leave	*
 * this here. It comes standard with UnrealIRCd.							*
